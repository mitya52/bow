* Bag-of-words model for getting features from images *
*******************************************************

Now it uses SIFT keypoints detector and decriptor (and works very slow) + get features from grayscale images.

============================================================

1) use feature_getter to get features from your samples (it takes a lot of time and memory);
2) next, train (or load) BoW-model and create BoW-features;
3) ???
4) PROFIT?
